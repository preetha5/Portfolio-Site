          <h2>Iyoga Transformation</h2>
          <h4>Navigating your Life and Soul</h4>
          <p>Benny Shamlou, the owner of Iyoga Transformation had a clear goal when she contacted me. She wanted to expand her profile to showcase beyond just basic yoga classes. She also offered her services as a business and personal assistant and she wanted her website users to know that and help expand her business.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, I set about collecting her goals, developing a new IA, creating lo-fi sketches and developing. I then went through the process of updating her images and updating the styles to blend along with her branding colors and logo.</p>
          <p>I chose the vantage theme builder in wordpress as it gave me a lot of free style layout capabilities. But
          I ripped out all the inbuilt styles, to add my own using custom CSS. I also had to remove and make some changes to the default layouts keeping the customer audience in mind. I also found the calendar plugin to be interesting as it needed customization of its own.</p>
          <p>After several testing rounds, the end result I came up with was very satisfying, content rich site and was a big leap from the old, outdated website. SEO was given high importance to help with her business and search results. Now Benny is very happy with her responsive and mission oriented website that has helped her reach more customers.</p>
